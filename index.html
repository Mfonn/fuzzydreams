            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3> Why is it so expensive?</h3>
            <p class="faq-p">Time is valuable. How valuable is your time to you? How much is your creativity worth to you? How much is taking that big step to bringing your idea to life worth to you? How much is regret of not going for your dreams worth to you? Working with people who value their time brings a different energy to the team.</p>
            
            <h3> What if I do not like the product after it's built?</h3>
            <p class="faq-p"> There are constant iterations during the entire process. You are not creatively stifled nor charged for changing your mind. Your satisfaction and dream are paramount.</p>
       
            <h3> What happens after 30 days?</h3>
            <p class="faq-p"> After the initial 30-day period, you will receive comprehensive documentation of your project, including brainstorming session notes, access to all code used, well-documented codebase, and necessary passwords and software access. This ensures you have complete ownership and control over your project moving forward.</p>
